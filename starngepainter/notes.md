 let's dry run the provided example with the given `targetGrid`:

```
targetGrid = [[1, 1, 1, 1],
              [1, 1, 3, 3],
              [1, 1, 3, 4],
              [5, 5, 1, 4]]
```

Step 1: Finding Distant Colors in the Grid
- We start by iterating through the `targetGrid` to find all distinct colors and store them in the set `st`.
- After the first pass, `st = {1, 3, 4, 5}`.

Step 2: Finding Coordinates of Colors
- Now, we iterate through each color in `st` and find the starting and ending row and column coordinates for each color. We store this information in the `row` and `col` maps.
- For color 1:
  - Coordinates: (0, 0) to (3, 3)
- For color 3:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2) to (2, 3)
- For color 4:
  - Coordinates: (2, 3) to (2, 3)
- For color 5:
  - Coordinates: (3, 0) to (3, 1)

Step 3: Building the Dependency Graph
- Next, we build the directed graph representing the dependency between colors. A color A is dependent on color B if color B is present in the rectangle of color A.
- For each color A, we find other colors B that are inside its rectangle and add edges from B to A in the graph. We also update the in-degree of A accordingly.
- The graph and in-degree information:
  - `graph = {1: {3}, 3: {4}, 4: {1}, 5: {1}}`
  - `indeg = {1: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0}`

Step 4: Standard Topological Sort
- Now, we perform a standard topological sort on the graph to check if there is a valid sequence of printing operations.
- Starting with colors with an in-degree of 0 (no dependency), we process the colors in a BFS manner and update the in-degree of adjacent colors.
- Queue: `q = {5}`
- After processing:
  - `cnt = 1`
  - `q = {}`

Step 5: Checking the Result
- Finally, we check if the `cnt` variable is equal to the number of distinct colors in the `targetGrid`. If they are equal, it means all colors were successfully processed in the topological sort, and we can return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.
- Since `cnt = 1` and there are 4 distinct colors in the `targetGrid`, the function returns `false`.

The result is `false`, indicating that it is not possible to print the `targetGrid` following the rules of the strange printer. The given grid does not meet the requirements of the puzzle with the given color dependencies.
