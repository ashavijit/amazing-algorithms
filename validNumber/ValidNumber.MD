### Problem Statement

A valid number can be split up into these components (in order):

A decimal number or an integer.
(Optional) An 'e' or 'E', followed by an integer.
A decimal number can be split up into these components (in order):

(Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
One of the following formats:
One or more digits, followed by a dot '.'.
One or more digits, followed by a dot '.', followed by one or more digits.
A dot '.', followed by one or more digits.
An integer can be split up into these components (in order):

(Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
One or more digits.
For example, all the following are valid numbers: ["2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789"], while the following are not valid numbers: ["abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53"].

Given a string s, return true if s is a valid number.


# Solution

### The algorithm checks whether a given string represents a valid number. Here is the intuition behind the algorithm, along with the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize the state variable to 0. The state represents the current state of the finite state machine used to validate the number.
2. Remove any leading and trailing whitespace characters from the input string.
3. Iterate through the characters of the string.
4. For each character:
- If the character is a digit between '0' and '9', update the state accordingly. If the current state is 0, 1, or 2, transition to state 2. Otherwise, transition to state 5 or 7.
- If the character is '+' or '-', check if the current state is 0 or 3. If so, transition to the next state. Otherwise, the input is invalid.
- If the character is '.', check if the current state is 0, 1, or 2. If so, transition to state 6. Otherwise, the input is invalid.
- If the character is 'e', check if the flag is set (indicating a valid digit sequence) and if the current state is 2, 6, or 7. If so, transition to state 3. Otherwise, the input is invalid.
- If none of the above conditions match, the input is invalid.
- After iterating through all characters, check the final state:
- If the final state is 2, 5, 6, or 7, the input is valid. Return true.
Otherwise, return false.


_This algorithm uses a finite state machine approach to validate the number based on the allowed transitions and conditions specified in the problem statement. The steps above outline the process of checking each character and updating the state accordingly, followed by evaluating the final state to determine if the number is valid._

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string. The algorithm iterates through each character of the string once.

- Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the state and flag variables.
